Is he a senile writer, dangerous criminal, or the greatest adventurer who ever lived?\n\nOne thing’s for sure: the journey he’s about to take her on will change her life forever.\n\nAs Aurora learns more about her new world, she begins to peel back the layers of a diabolical conspiracy; one that threatens to engulf the whole world, and will make her question everything – and everyone – she thinks she knows.\n\nIncluding herself…"

Now she's back, but he's not, and Aurora's memory of their adventure - as well as her powers - has faded. It's like it never happened.\n\nBut change is coming. The world continues to darken, the threat of the Riftrot continues to grow, and the newest incarnation of the Umbra is more dangerous than ever, and poses personal significance to Aurora.\nAnd alone and forgotten, an angry young man plots his revenge against the Ne'er DuWells with a weapon that could doom the world.\n\nWhether she likes it or not, Aurora is going to be dragged back into the world of the Unseen; the memories she lost may prove to be her greatest resource, but what they might reveal may change everything she thinks she knows, and forever."
